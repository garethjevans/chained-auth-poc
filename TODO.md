# TODO List of Features

1. Create a github workflow that will run a gradle build for each PR
2. Create a cursor rules file that ensures that the project is validated by running a gradle test
3. Create a module called auth-adapter in the applications directory.  This module will act as a spring authorization server that will connect to github.
